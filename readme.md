#react-gulp-starter

Basically [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate), but with a gulpfile because I want to have some formal build tool integration. Also some boilerplate linter configs and travis config.

Using [webpack-hot-middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware) for the hot reloading. Using [babel-plugin-react-transform](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform) for the react hot loading.

```
npm install
gulp // dev server
gulp build // build into dist folder
```
